## claude-kit (JohnnyVizz): savvy-progress and savvy-flow

From [claude-kit](https://github.com/JohnnyVizz/claude-kit):

- The progress bar, the crab and the agents panel (the progress part of `hooks/register.tsx`) start from
  its savvy-progress mod.
- `skills/savvy-flow` and `agents/savvy-*.md` are its savvy-flow plugin (copied at claude-kit c871c15), with
  the progress tools renamed to `mcp__crabhud__progress` and `mcp__crabhud__step`. Its pixel bar and gliding pill adapt
[plan-progress](https://github.com/zycck/claude-mods) by Kirill Serditov (MIT).
